Hi,

This text document will contain all of the notes that I write
while reading through 'The Rust Programming Language'. I'll 
split em up by chapter. The rest of the documents in this repo
will be code snippets and projects from the book. Each chapter 
will have it's own directory and that'll contain all of the code
from that chapter. Okay? Okay.
